    <!--Used a single favicon for simplicity. In real apps, favicons are far more nuanced and would required different formats and sizes of files that should be created and linked here.-->

<!--    Loading fonts has more nuances than we usually think about. In the below link the fonts are configured with two best practices.
    1. Load only the font weights and styles you need, This should save precious milliseconds to the browser downloading the fonts.
    2. rel preload is used to tell the browser that this font file has to be downloaded as soon as possible. Browser can't ignore this preload attribute, it is mandatory. That said, we should not preload everything, Then the browser won't have a chance to optimize the loading pipeline.

    <!--Trying to prefetch the SVG assets that are loaded dynamically into DOM.
    Having the browser download them once the DOM is loaded is not always a pleasant UX.
    This will tell the browser that we'll use this asset in future.

    But it is upto the browser to decide whether to download it or not.
    Firefox only prefetches when the browser is Idle. Nevertheless, this is useful to reduce the flickering effect of image loading in dynamic DOM.
   Browser can decide not to prefetch the asset if the user is on a slow or a mobile connection. We hand the control to the browser to do best when we are using prefetch.
