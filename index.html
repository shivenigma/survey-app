<!--    Loading fonts has more nuances than we usually think about. In the below link the fonts are configured with two best practices.
    1. Load only the font weights and styles you need, This should save precious milliseconds to the browser downloading the fonts.
    2. rel preload is used to tell the browser that this font file has to be downloaded as soon as possible. Browser can't ignore this preload attribute, it is mandatory. That said, we should not preload everything, Then the browser won't have a chance to optimize the loading pipeline.

<!--We don't really need this container div here and could've set the margins to Body. But it is not unusual for custom widgets to be added or layout changed after the initial designs. So I limit the margins to a container and leave body untouched to be future proof.-->
